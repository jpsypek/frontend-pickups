# Sportster

Sportster is an online resource to create and view all pick-up sports that are happening in your area. This application was built with React and the Google Maps API utilizing a RESTful API built with Ruby on Rails and a Postgres database.

## Getting Started

2. run rails db:create to create the Postgres db
3. run rails db:seed to seed the db
4. run rails s to run the backend server
5. git clone the frontend repository (https://github.com/jpsypek/backend-pickups)
6. run npm start to the frontend server
